A shoop 'em up game created using the *Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development* textbook. This games purpose is to shoot projectiles as a Hero ship at the 5 different enemy ships that spawn in at random.

### Description
- **Score Counter:** We have added a score counter for the game in the top right corner to track the players progress and points. Listed below are the enemies and their point values:
  - Enemy_0 = 100
  - Enemy_1 = 250
  - Enemy_2 = 250
  - Enemy_3 = 350
  - Enemy_4 = 450
- **Power Up Sound:** A audio clip plays whenever the player picks up a new power up to enchance their blaster or replenishing their shield.

### Gameplay Impact
- **Strategy**: Players can plan out which enemies they would like to shoot in order to get the most points.
- **Challenge**: The score counter allows the player to feel achievement from shooting certain enenmies over others. Since, some of the enemies are more diffcult to destroy than others we provided more points to relfect difficulty.
- **Audio Cues**: Players now get notified when they have picked up an item, increasing their engagement with the game as they strive to collect more power ups.
